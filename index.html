    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> <span class="head2"> Annual Festivals in Puerto Rico </span></h2>
    <p><b>Almost every weekend, there is a <span class="head3"><b>festival or celebration</b></span> around the Island. These are some of the biggest and most popular.</b></p>
    <p>Festivals in Puerto Rico are colorful and loud: live bands play, amusement park rides twirl, parades take over streets, and, of course, fried foods are enjoyed. Each festival is rooted in tradition, often Catholic in origin, starting mostly mid-week and lasting through the weekend.</p>
    <p>Some events are held in the <u><b>San Juan</b></u> metro area, while others will require a road trip to explore more of Puerto Rico. Going to a Puerto Rican festival is a great way to experience <u><b>Boricua</b></u> culture while having a great time.</p>

    <h2>Fiesta de los Reyes Magos</h2>
    <p>January 6 – <u><b>Juana Díaz</b></u>, <u><b>Isabela</b></u>, and other municipalities</p>
    <p>Along with Christmas and New Year's, the Epiphany on January 6th is also celebrated as part of the holiday season in Puerto Rico. According to Catholic tradition, the <u><b>Three Wise Men</b></u> (in Spanish, los Tres Reyes Magos) visited baby Jesus in the manger to deliver gifts. In Puerto Rico, town festivals throw parades featuring locals and actors dressed as the Three Wise Men as they pass out presents to children. The two most famous festivals are Fiesta de Reyes Juanadina, in the town of Juana Díaz, and Fiesta de Reyes Isabelinos, in Isabela.</p>
    <h2>Fiestas de la Calle San Sebastián</h2>
    <p>Third weekend of January – <u><b>Old San Juan</b></u></p>
    <p>One of the most anticipated parties of the year and the unofficial close of the holiday season, the <u><b>Fiestas de la Calle San Sebastián</b></u> takes over Old San Juan from Wednesday evening until Sunday afternoon. During the day, plazas are filled to the brim with artists and artisans; some have stages for live music, dance, and circus performances. In the evening, the party ignites, and the street fills with people and music. </p>
    <h2>Festival de la Novilla</h2>
    <p>Third weekend of January – <u><b>San Sebastián</b></u></p>
    <p>A novilla is a heifer, and it is the focus of a popular celebration in San Sebastián, a rural town on the west side of the Island. Celebrated on Sunday, live bands perform everything from folk music to salsa, artisans, and fried food vendors occupy the town square, and amusement park rides are set up. A cow is decked out in a crown of flowers and leads a parade through the town where scenes of country life are depicted on elaborate floats. The <u><b>Festival de la Novilla</b></u> closes with a concert of traditional music.</p>
